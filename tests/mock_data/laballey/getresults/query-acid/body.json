      "description": "About Stearic Acid Stearic Acid, Octadecanoic Acid, Stearophanic Acid, and n-Octadecanoic Acid, has the chemical formula C18H36O2 or CH3(CH2)16COOH. It is one of the useful types of saturated fatty acids that are obtained from vegetable/plants fats and oils. Stearic Acid appears as a hard, white, or faintly yellowish crystalline solid having a tallow odor. It is insoluble in Water, slightly soluble in Ethanol, and freely soluble in Acetone at ambient conditions. It is produced on a commercial scale by the hydrogenation of the unsaturated 18-carbon fatty acids of soybean, cottonseed, or other vegetable oils.   Stearic Acid is an emulsifier, emollient, and lubricant that can soften skin and help to keep products from separating. It is ..."

      "description": "About Succinic Acid Succinic Acid, IUPAC name Butanedioic Acid, C4H6O4 is a dicarboxylic acid. At room temperature the acid is a white solid.   Succinic Acid is used in as stock chemical for the production of 1,4-Butanediol (BDO). The automotive and electronics industries use BDO for many plastic car part and insulators. Succinic Acid is used as an acidity regulator and flavor enhancer in food, in the manufacture of drugs, and in dietary supplements. In addition to the pure acid, it is often offered for sale as its sodium salt, C4H4O4Na2. The Disodium Salt is also a white crystalline solid and has an acidic taste. The hexahydrate form of the salt is used in the manufacture of the topical preparation for cataract treatment. Common Uses ..."

      "description": "About Phosphoric Acid  Phosphoric acid, also known as orthophosphoric acid, is a weak triprotic acid. Its most common form is in 75-85% aqueous solution, as a colorless and odorless viscous liquid; however, in its pure form, it is a white solid at room temperature and pressure. It is a cost-effective, widely available reagent with a wide range of applications.  The most common usage is in fertilizers, accounting for more than 75% of its use. Phosphoric acid is (generally) nontoxic with a tangy taste, and is therefore used in its food grade form (additive E338) as a pH modifier, flavor enhancer, and preservative, particularly in cola beverages. In dentistry, phosphoric acid is a useful whitening, cleaning, and roughening agent. In ..."
